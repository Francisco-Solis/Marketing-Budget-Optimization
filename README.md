# Marketing-Budget-Optimization
This repository focuses on utilizing **MATLAB**'s optimization tool's in order to determine which combination of marketing campaigns yields the largest profit. 

# Overview:
This project models an optimization problem in **MATLAB** where the goal is to find the combination of marketing campaigns that result in the biggest profit, while ensuring that none of the constraints (ads being displayed simultaneously) are violated. The constraints bridge the gap between theory and application because in real world scenarios there are restrictions like time, resources, and budget.
